### **DATA & FILE OVERVIEW**

#### **Data & Analysis Component**
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**raw_data**:
Contains raw data files generated by Open Sesame in `.csv`, including the `Pilot 1-3/pilot_03` which served as the input for all statistical scripts.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**plots**:
Contains publication ready plots generated by `01_plotting.R`
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**derived_data**:
Contains data files generated during the preprocessing stage (`derivedDF.csv`), summaries of posterior extractions (`posteriors_cluster_probs.csv`, `posteriors_cluster_logodds.csv`, `posteriors_output_cond.csv`). It also contains the fake data simulated for the power analysis (`fakeData.csv`)
Relevant for plotting and modelling.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**scripts**
Contains R scripts to process, analyze and plot data:
&nbsp;&nbsp;

`00_preprocessing.R` prepares the raw mousetracking data for further processing and stores the data tables in `derived_data`.
&nbsp;&nbsp;

`01_plotting.R` generates figures for manuscript and stores them in `plots`.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

`02_modelling.R` runs Bayesian hierarchical models and extracts posteriors. It stores posteriors into `derived_data` and the model into `models`. It further plots the results against the data and stores them in `plots`.
&nbsp;&nbsp;

`03_simulateData.R` simulates fake data based on the pilot data and runs a power analysis. It stores the outcome in `derived_data` and generates a power curve plot, stored in `plots`.
&nbsp;&nbsp;

**models**:
Contains model output generated by `02_modeling.R`
